new fetures:
no new fetures as of this point not so say it will never happen just not yet just getting it up and running first is the main thing

I will be making this a paid tweak $3.49 the original tweak is $2.49 that will be keeped aside in case the original owner comes back in I'm not here to rip people off from the date I receive the first payment i will be keeping the $2.49 from every purchase for the original owner for 1 year if he does not get in contact after one year from the date then I will be keeping the funds and dropping the price back down to the $2.49 as I not here to get rich of someone else's work but just to cover the cost of my time to keep this grate tweak alive.

I would like to say a big thank you to the people that have helped me make this happen:

Allan Kerr the person that makes this tweak in the first place

more to follow if I get help

myself to prove that even someone like me with dyslexia can do something to help the jailbreaking community

FreeNAS OS for my Home Server's

Youtube for the vid's that have helped me do this I will list them all soon more to follow when I have spoken to them if I can post they vids

In case anyone is wondering I started using jailbroken devices from the iPhone original 2G,3GS,4S,5S,6S+,8+ I do like the S models. I only have 2 iPads Air 2 and Pro 12.9. I have the Apple TV 3 and 4 sadly both not jailbroken yet and I have the Apple Watch 1st gen. I now have the 5C I got of eBay on 10.3.3 sadly I don't have any of the SHSH2 blobs saved I just want to help put something back into the community.
